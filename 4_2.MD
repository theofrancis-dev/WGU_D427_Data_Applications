# 4.12 LAB - Implement strong entity (Sakila)

Implement a new strong entity phone in the Sakila database. Attributes and relationships are shown in the following diagram:
![Diagram](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ohsvnbcqrws10zfc6554l/D427_ex_4_2.jpg?rlkey=796r2hkbhavhnw2ouzt925htl&dl=0)

The diagram uses Sakila naming conventions. Follow the Sakila conventions for your table and column names:

* All lower case
* Underscore separator between root and suffix
* Foreign keys have the same name as referenced primary key

Write CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements that:

* Implement the entity as a new phone table.
* Implement the has relationships as foreign keys in the Sakila customer, staff, and store tables.
* Remove the existing phone column from the Sakila address table.

Step 2 requires adding a foreign key constraint to an existing table. Ex:

Specify data types as follows:

* phone_id, phone_number, and country_code have data type INT.
* phone_type has data type VARCHAR(12) and contains strings like 'Home', 'Mobile', and 'Other'.

Apply these constraints:

* NOT NULL constraints correspond to cardinalities on the diagram above.
* Foreign key actions are SET NULL for delete rules and CASCADE for update rules.
* Specify a suitable column as the phone table primary key.


	ALTER TABLE customer 
	  ADD FOREIGN KEY (phone_id) REFERENCES phone(phone_id)
	  ON DELETE SET NULL
	  ON UPDATE CASCADE;


	CREATE TABLE phone (
	phone_id INT PRIMARY KEY,    
    country_code INT NOT NULL,
    phone_number INT NOT NULL,
    phone_type VARCHAR(12) CHECK (phone_type IN ('Home','Mobile','Other') )
	);

	/*customer table, new foreign key*/
	ALTER TABLE customer 
	ADD COLUMN phone_id INT,
	ADD FOREIGN KEY (phone_id) REFERENCES phone(phone_id)
	ON DELETE SET NULL
	ON UPDATE CASCADE;
 
	/*staff table, new foreign key*/
	ALTER TABLE staff 
	ADD COLUMN phone_id INT,
	ADD FOREIGN KEY (phone_id) REFERENCES phone(phone_id)
	ON DELETE SET NULL
	ON UPDATE CASCADE;
	  
	/*store table, new foreign key*/
	ALTER TABLE store 	
	 ADD COLUMN phone_id INT,
	 ADD FOREIGN KEY (phone_id) REFERENCES phone(phone_id)
	 ON DELETE SET NULL
	 ON UPDATE CASCADE;
	 
	ALTER TABLE address DROP phone;
	 /*in case you need to delete a foreign key
	ALTER TABLE table_name DROP FOREIGN KEY foreign_keys_name;
