# 3.6 LAB - Multiple joins with aggregate (Sakila)
Refer to the film, actor, and film_actor tables of the Sakila database. The tables in this lab have the same columns and data types but fewer rows.

Write a query that:

* Computes the average length of all films that each actor appears in.
* Rounds average length to the nearest minute and renames the result column "average".
* Displays last name, first name, and average, in that order, for each actor.
* Sorts the result in descending order by average, then ascending order by last name.
* The query should exclude films with no actors and actors that do not appear in films.

Hint: Use the ROUND() and AVG() functions.

## solution:

	SELECT actor.last_name, actor.first_name, ROUND(AVG(film.length),0) AS Average
	FROM film
	INNER JOIN film_actor ON film.film_id = film_actor.film_id
	INNER JOIN actor ON film_actor.actor_id = actor.actor_id
	GROUP BY actor.actor_id
	ORDER BY  Average DESC, actor.last_name ASC;
