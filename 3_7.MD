#3.7 LAB - Nested aggregates (Sakila)
Refer to the film and inventory tables of the Sakila database. The tables in this lab have the same columns and data types but fewer rows.

Write a query that lists the titles of films with the fewest rows in the inventory table.

This query requires a subquery that computes the minimum of counts by film_id:

	SELECT MIN(count_film_id) 
	FROM ( SELECT COUNT(film_id) AS count_film_id
		FROM inventory
		GROUP BY film_id ) 
		AS temp_table;

##solution steps:

###1-find all films on inventory

    SELECT film.film_id, film.title
    FROM film
    RIGHT JOIN inventory ON film.film_id = inventory.film_id
    ORDER BY film.title;

###2-Group By film.film_id and Count it
    SELECT film.film_id, film.title,COUNT(*)
    FROM film
    RIGHT JOIN inventory ON film.film_id = inventory.film_id
    GROUP BY film.film_id
    ORDER BY film.film_id;

###3-Filter only those with the minimal rows in inventory (the subquery given returns 2, you can try out any number for testing)
    
    SELECT film.film_id, film.title,COUNT(*) AS C
    FROM film
    RIGHT JOIN inventory ON film.film_id = inventory.film_id
    GROUP BY film.film_id
    HAVING C = 2
    ORDER BY film.film_id;

###4-Replace 2, with the subquery given in the exercise:

	SELECT film.film_id, film.title,COUNT(*) AS C
    FROM film
    RIGHT JOIN inventory ON film.film_id = inventory.film_id
    GROUP BY film.film_id
    HAVING C = 
      ( SELECT MIN(count_film_id) FROM 
      ( SELECT COUNT(film_id) AS count_film_id
        FROM inventory
        GROUP BY film_id ) 
    AS temp_table )
    ORDER BY film.film_id;
    
##5-Remove film_id and count from the final result to match what the lab requires.

    SELECT film.title
    FROM film
    RIGHT JOIN inventory ON film.film_id = inventory.film_id
    GROUP BY film.film_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 
      ( SELECT MIN(count_film_id) FROM 
      ( SELECT COUNT(film_id) AS count_film_id
        FROM inventory
        GROUP BY film_id ) 
    AS temp_table )
    ORDER BY film.film_id;
